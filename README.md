Computer Vision and Machine Learning Projects
Simon Fraser University — Jan 2023 – Apr 2023

Developed a CNN-based digit recognition system from scratch in MATLAB, implementing forward and backward passes for convolution, pooling, ReLU, and fully connected layers; achieved 97% test accuracy and 75% real-world prediction accuracy.

Engineered an image feature matching pipeline using BRIEF descriptors and evaluated robustness against SURF under rotation; computed homographies and applied RANSAC for robust image alignment.

Created an augmented reality application by warping virtual content into real-world scenes using planar homography estimation.

Implemented the eight-point algorithm and triangulation for 3D reconstruction from stereo image pairs; computed fundamental and essential matrices and evaluated epipolar geometry through re-projection error analysis.

Built a stereo vision pipeline including image rectification, dense disparity mapping, and depth map computation from stereo images using camera intrinsics and extrinsics.
